# Content of mods not updated

There are multiple possible reasons:
1. Something goes wrong with Steam Workshop and updates are not downloaded automatically. Go to `Properties/Installed Files` and click "Verify integrity of game files" on Steam.
2. There are mods with repeated "ID". Find and delete the one of repeated mods.
3. Try to update NML manually, and delete folder `GAMEPATH/worldbox_Data/StreamingAssets/mods/NML`

# NML installed with NCMS

1. NML gives up loading mods under "GAMEPATH/Mods" when NCMS exists.

# Game crash or stuck at launching

1. Try to update NML once.
2. Report bug
