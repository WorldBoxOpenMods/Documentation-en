## Discord

You need to have `Modder` role in WorldBox official discord server. Contact with administrator to get it.

## Github Organization

You need to join `WorldBoxOpenMods` organization on github which owns `NML`. Send an email titled "WorldBoxOpenMods" and with your github username as content and your mod as attachment to <wbopenmods@gmail.com>. Then wait for at most a week.

## Skip Authentication

If you skip authentication, your mod will be uploaded with tag `Unverified Mods`.

You need to make sure your mod works in any directory.
