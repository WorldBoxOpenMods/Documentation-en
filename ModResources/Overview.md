# Introduction

You can load resources in different ways.

# Get resources in game

You can get `Resources` structure in [Resources](./Resources.md)

## Sprite

### Single sprite

It is common to get a single sprite through `SpriteTextureLoader.getSprite(string path)` manually.

Parameter `path` is the path to the sprite resource in `Resources`(a unity class).

Such as

```csharp
SpriteTextureLoader.getSprite("ui/icons/iconOption")
```

### Sprite list

It is common to get a list of sprites through `SpriteTextureLoader.getSpriteList(string path)` manually.

It is `Resources.LoadAll` with cache. Parameter `path` is the path to the sprites resources in `Resources`.

Such as

```csharp
SpriteTextureLoader.getSpriteList("effects/projectiles/arrow")
```

## Others

For other resources, you can load them through [`Resources.Load`](https://docs.unity.cn/cn/2019.4/ScriptReference/Resources.Load.html) or [`Resources.LoadAll`](https://docs.unity.cn/cn/2019.4/ScriptReference/Resources.LoadAll.html). 

# Add resources to game


## Add resources automatically

It only supports to add sprites and text automatically. 

Make a folder named "GameResources" in your mod folder and see it as "Resources" folder in unity. Place your pictures or texts in it. It's case-insensitive about folder and file name.

For sprite, you can configure your sprite through `sprites.json` or `*.meta`(if you dont know what's meta file in unity, just use sprites.json).

### sprites.json

A sprites.json file will be deserialized into an instance of `SpritesSettings`.

Definition of `SpritesSettings`:
```csharp
class SpritesSettings
{
    public Setting Default;
    public List<Setting> Specific;
}
class Setting
{ 
    public float BorderB = 0.0f; // border bottom
    public float BorderL = 0.0f; // border left
    public float BorderR = 0.0f; // border right
    public float BorderT = 0.0f; // border top
    public string Path = "\\";   // corresponded file path
    public float PivotX = 0.5f;  // pivot x, default to be center
    public float PivotY = 0.0f;  // pivot y, default to be center
    public float PixelsPerUnit = 1f; // if you dont know what it is, keep it 1
    public float RectX = 0.0f;   // keep it 0 now
    public float RectY = 0.0f;   // keep it 0 now
}
```

Default setting will be applied to files which have not Specific setting.

### *.meta

It is a meta file generated by unity, it is used to load atlas or sprite sheet.
